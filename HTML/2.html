<th>Diwali also known as the "festival of lights", is an ancient Hindu festival celebrated in autumn every year. The festival spiritually signifies the victory of
light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, and hope over despair. The festival preparations and rituals typically extend over a five day
period, but the main festival night of Diwali coincides with the darkest, new moon night of the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartik. In the Gregorian calendar, Diwali night 
falls between mid-October and mid-November.Before Diwali night, people clean, renovate and decorate their homes. On Diwali night, Hindus dress up in new clothes or their best outfit, light updiyas 
(lamps and candles) inside and outside their home, participate in family puja typically to Lakshmi - the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Afterpuja (prayers), 
fireworks follow, then a family feast including mithai (sweets), and an exchange of gifts between family members and close friends. Diwali also marks a major
shopping period in nations where it is celebrated.Diwali is an important festival for Hindus. The name of festive days as well as the rituals of Diwali vary significantly 
among Hindus, based on the region of India.In many parts of India, the festivities start with Dhanteras, followed by Naraka Chaturdasi on second day, Diwali on the third day,
Diwali Padva dedicated to wife-husband relationship on the fourth day, and festivities end with Bhau-beej dedicated to sister-brother bond on the fifth day. Dhanteras usually 
falls eighteen days after Dussehra.On the same night that Hindus celebrate Diwali, Jains celebrate a festival of lights to mark the attainment of moksha by Mahavira, and Sikhscelebrate 
Bandi Chhor Divas.Diwali is an official holiday in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Malaysia, Singapore and Fiji. <p><center><h3><u> Significance </u> </h3></center>Diwali is one of the happiest of holidays in India, with significant preparations. People clean their homes and 
decorate them for the festivities. Diwali is one of the biggest shopping seasons in India; people buy new clothes for themselves and their families, gifts, appliances, 
kitchen utensils, small to big ticket items such as cars and gold jewelry. People also buy gifts for family members and friends which typically includes sweets, dry fruits and seasonal specialities
depending on regional harvest and customs.It is also the period when little kids hear ancient stories, legends, myths and battle between good and evil, light and 
darkness from their parents and elders. Girls and women go shopping, and create rangoli and other creative patterns on floors, near doors and walkways. Youth and 
grown ups graduate to helping with lighting and preparing for patakhe (fireworks).There is significant variation in regional practices and rituals. Depending
on the region, prayers are offered before one or more deities, with most common being Lakshmi - the goddess of wealth and prosperity. On Diwali night, fireworks light
up the neighborhood skies. Later, family members and invited friends celebrate the night over food and sweets.</p><p><center><h3><u> Description and Rituals </u> </h3></center>Diwali is a five day festival in many regions of India, with Diwali night centering on the new moon - 
the darkest night - at the end of the Hindu lunar month of Ashvin and the start of the month ofKartika. In the Common Era calendar, Diwali typically falls towards the 
end of October, or first half of November each year. The darkest night of autumn lit with diyas, candles and lanterns, makes the festival of lights particularly
memorable. Diwali is also a festival of sounds and sights with fireworks and rangoli designs; the festival is a major celebration of flavors with feasts and 
numerous mithai (sweets, desserts), as well as a festival of emotions where Diwali ritually brings family and friends together every year.
Like major festivals of the world, rituals and preparations for the Indian festival Diwali begin days or weeks in advance. The festival formally begins two days before
 the night of Diwali, and ends two days after.
