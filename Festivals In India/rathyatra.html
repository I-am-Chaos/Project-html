      <p align="justify" class="style1">Ratha Yatra is also known as Festival of Chariot. Every year Shri Jagannath's chariots is celebrated at Puri, in Orissa. The second day, known as dwitiya, of moon's waxing cycle (shukla pakshya) of lunar calendar's third month (Ashadh Maas). Puri's main temple Jagannath's deities- Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra with sudarshana chakra (celestial wheel), are carried out of the temple precincts in a form of a ritual procession in their respective chariots. The chariots are huge and are decorated with various colours. A large number of devotees draw the chariots to the Gundicha Temple at a distance of two miles to the North. Gundicha is King Indradyumna's Queen.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">On the way back from Gundicha Temple, these deities halt at the Mausi Maa Temple, where their aunt was abode, and get an offering of Poda Pitha. This is a special pancake type, which is the Lord's favourite. After a stay for seven days, the deities return to their abode.</p>
