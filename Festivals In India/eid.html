      <p>Eid or Eid-ul-Fitr is the greatest festival of the Muslims. The Muslims, all over the world, celebrate it with great pomp and show, zeal and gusto.</p>
      <p>This festival marks the end of Ramadan. Ramadan is a holy month of fasting. The Muslims observe fasts for a full month after sighting the moon of &lsquo;Ramzan&rsquo;. When the month of &lsquo;Ramzan&rsquo;, is over and the moon of Eid is sighted, they end their Roja (fasts). In this way, the Muslims break their month-long fast. The next day, the festival of Eid is celebrated. Every year it comes off on the first day of the month of Shawwal. It is a day of gaiety, festivity and feasting.<br />
      </p>
      <p> <br />
        It is a believed that fasting in the month of &lsquo;Ramzan&rsquo; purifies the soul. The prayers after fasting save them from going to hell and open the doors of heaven. Thus, they lead a pure and holy life during the month of &lsquo;Ramzan&rsquo;. They observe fasts, offer regular prayers in the form of &lsquo;Namaz&rsquo;; read the holy Koran, feed the hungry and give alms to the poor. Charity is the greatest virtue to be practiced during the month of &lsquo;Ramzan&rsquo;. Fasting comes to an end when the new moon of Eid is sighted. The sight of the new moon of Eid is considered very pious and holy by the Muslims. It is a signal for the celebration of Eid the very next day.</p>
      <p>On the Eid day, Muslim people get up early in the morning. They take a bath and put on their best dresses. Houses are decorated. They thank Allah, visit mosques and offer prayers in the form of &lsquo;Namaz&rsquo;. They embrace one another and exchange Eid greetings. &lsquo;Eid Mubarak&rsquo; is on the lips of each Muslim. Sweets are distributed, gifts are given and delicious dishes are prepared at home. Friends and relatives are invited to feasts. Sweet noodles are the most popular dish cooked on this day. At some places, Eid fairs are also held. Eid greetings are exchanged by one and all. Children buy toys and sweets.</p>
      <p>In India, all communities join the Muslims in celebrating Eid. Sweets are shared and greetings exchanged by all. The Hindus, Sikhs and Christians greet their Muslim brothers on this day. The celebration of Eid promotes national integration and the feeling of brotherhood. Joys are doubled when they are shared. Eid brings a message of brotherhood for all of us.</p>
