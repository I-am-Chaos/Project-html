  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Reuse any items that you can. Items like clothing, bottles, wrapping paper and shopping bags can be used over and over again, rather than buying new things. <br><br> The greatest prevention to land pollution is in the three ‘R's’ … <br>
Reduce Waste, Re-use things and <br>Recycle things. This is true even for governments. They can also use the three ‘R’ rule to minimize the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. After the three 'R's, remember to turn the rest of the garbge into compost. <br><br>
  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Personal litter should be disposed properly. We can separate household waste at home for recycling. More than half of our household waste could be recycled or re-used but once it is mixed up, it becomes more difficult to separate different components for recycling. This is also true for waste we make at school or hospitals. <br><br>
  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Buy biodegradable products. <br><br>
  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Store all liquid chemicals and waste in spill-proof containers. <br><br>

  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Eat organic foods that are grown without pesticides. Look out for fertilizer or pesticide free products when you go to the market. <br>
<br>
  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Don’t use pesticides if you can. <br><br>
  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Use a drip tray to collect engine oil. <br><br>
  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Buy products that have little packaging. <br><br>

  <img src="image/bullet.jpg" width="20" height="14">Don’t dump motor oil on the ground. <br><br> Governments can also ensure that there are incentives for people to recycle and re-use things.
