In many cities, your local environment office can help with the disposal of medicines and chemicals. Check with your local authorities if there is a chemical disposal plan for local residents. <br><br>

These laws are usually directed at industries, hospitals, schools and market areas on how to dispose, treat and manage sewage. Do you know the laws in your country? This is the time to find out. <br><br>
In many developed cities, waste or sewage treatment is very efficient, and designed to minimise pollution of water bodies. <br>There are also lots of organizations and groups that help educate people on the dangers of water pollution. It is always great to join these groups, because they regularly encourage  other members of their communities to have a better attitude towards water.
