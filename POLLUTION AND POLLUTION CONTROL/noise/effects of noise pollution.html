The immediate and acute effect of noise pollution to a person, over a period of time, is impairment of hearing. Prolonged exposure to impulsive noise to a person will damage their eardrum, which may result in a permanent hearing impairment. <br>

Marine scientists are concerned about excessive noise used by oil drills, submarines and other vessels on and inside the ocean. Many marine animals, especially whales, use hearing to find food, communicate, defend and survive in the ocean. Excessive noises are causing a lot of injuries and deaths to whales. For example, the effect of a navy submarine’s sonar  can be felt 300 miles away from the source. <br>

  Many of these beached whales have suffered physical trauma, including bleeding around the brain, ears and other tissues and large bubbles in their organs. There is no question that sonar injures and kills whales and dolphins. <br>

This is not only about whales, but the larger marine life are all affected in one way or the other. <br>

Health effects of noise include anxiety and stress reaction&nbsp; and in extreme cases fright. The physiological manifestations are headaches, irritability and nervousness, feeling of fatigue and decreases work efficiency. For example, being pounded by the siren of fire fighters, police or ambulance in your city all night everyday leave people (especially elderly people) stresses and tired in the morning. <br>Its is worth noting that these effects may not sound troubling, but the truth is, with time, the consequences can be very worrying.
