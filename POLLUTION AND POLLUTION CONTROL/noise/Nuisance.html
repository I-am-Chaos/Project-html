It includes conduct that interferes with public health, safety, peace or convenience. This is a term that is mostly used in law and court rooms. <br>
Statutory Nuisance can also be used for instances including the adverse effects of artificial light, dust, odour and insects. <br>Generally, all the above can mean different things to different people. For example, if your neighbor is a lover of cats, and you are not, it will not be long before you have problems if the cats keep coming to your balcony. Another cat lover may find this  exciting and will be very happy with that. <br>So you see, usually, the term 'Nuisance' is used in relation to the average or generally acceptable conditions of a place or group of people.
