<br>
    <img src="image/common-air-pollutants.jpg" width="497" height="267"><br><br><em>
<b>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</b></em><br>
    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Fuel combustion from vehicles and engines. <br>

    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Reduces the amount of oxygen reaching the body’s organs and tissues; aggravates heart disease, resulting in chest pain and other symptoms. <br><br><em><b>Ground-level Ozone (O3)</b></em><br>
    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Secondary pollutant formed by chemical reaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx in the presence of sunlight. <br>
    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Decreases lung function and causes respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, and also makes asthma and other lung diseases get worse. <br><br><em><b>Lead (Pb)</b></em><br>

    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Smelters (metal refineries) and other metal industries; combustion of leaded gasoline in piston engine aircraft; waste incinerators (waste burners), and battery manufacturing. <br>

    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Damages the developing nervous system, resulting in IQ loss and impacts on learning, memory, and behavior in children. Cardiovascular and renal effects in adults and early effects related to anaemia. <br>
<br><em><b>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)</b></em><br>
    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Fuel combustion (electric utilities, big industrial boilers, vehicles) and wood burning. <br>

    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Worsens lung diseases leading to respiratory symptoms, increased susceptibility to respiratory infection. <br><br><em><b>Particulate Matter (PM)</b></em><br>

    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">This is formed through chemical reactions, fuel combustion (e.g., burning coal, wood, diesel), industrial processes, farming (plowing, field burning), and unpaved roads or during road constructions. <br>
    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Short-term exposures can worsen heart or lung diseases and cause respiratory problems. Long-term exposures can cause  heart or lung disease and sometimes premature deaths. <br><br><em><b>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)</b></em><br>

    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">SO2 comes from fuel combustion (especially high-sulfur coal); electric utilities and industrial processes as well as  natural occurances like volcanoes. <br>
    <img src="image/did-you-know-button.jpg" width="20" height="14">Aggravates asthma and makes breathing difficult. It also contributes to particle formation with associated health effects.
